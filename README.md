# GFICLEE: Gene function inferred by common loss evolution events


GFICLEE is a program for predicting biological pathway or biological complex new member. 
It is based on the common loss events in gene evolution. When input a gene set in same biological pathway, 
this program will scan all reference genome predict potential members of this pathway. 
This program requires three inputs, (1) the gene set in same biological pathway or biological complex, 
(2)a binary species tree, (3) the binary phylogenetic profile of all genes in this reference genome across the species.
